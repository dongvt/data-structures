# Welcome

In this document we will learn what is, how to use, and some examples for the following data structures:

* [Linked-List](1-linkedList.md)
* [Queue](2-queue.md)
* [Tree](3-tree.md)

The performance is discussed in each of the sections. While big O notation for space complexity is out of the scope of this course, this is also discussed because each O(n<sup>2</sup>) performance and O(1) space, can obtimize performance by using more memory
