# Queue: First-in-first-out (FiFo)

A queue is a data structure in which the elements inserted go out in the same order they were inserted. The first element going in, will be the first element going out.

In queues we don't focus in getting each element separately when needed. Instead, we add multiple elements and the only way we have the access the last one we inserted is getting all other elements in the queue.
